/**
 * The application service that acts as a facade for actions relevant to the
 * User domain object.
 * 
 * A general note on exception handling for all checked exceptions thrown by the
 * facade:
 * 
 * When an exception is encountered, the exception may contain a set of
 * ConstraintViolation instances when bean validation of the inputs have failed.
 * 
 * Also, the message property of the exception may not contain a human-readable
 * message. Instead it would contain a key to a resource bundle that will be
 * used to display localized human readable messages to users.
 * 
 * Clients of this service must first parse the Set of ConstraintViolations, and
 * then parse the message property of the Exception to prepare human readable
 * message.
